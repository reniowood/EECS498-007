  Computes the squared Euclidean distance between each element of the training
  set and each element of the test set. Images should be flattened and treated
  as vectors.

  This implementation uses a naive set of nested loops over the training and
  test data.

  The input data may have any number of dimensions -- for example this function
  should be able to compute nearest neighbor between vectors, in which case
  the inputs will have shape (num_{train, test}, D); it should alse be able to
  compute nearest neighbors between images, where the inputs will have shape
  (num_{train, test}, C, H, W). More generally, the inputs will have shape
  (num_{train, test}, D1, D2, ..., Dn); you should flatten each element
  of shape (D1, D2, ..., Dn) into a vector of shape (D1 * D2 * ... * Dn) before
  computing distances.

  The input tensors should not be modified.

  NOTE: Your implementation may not use `torch.norm`, `torch.dist`,
